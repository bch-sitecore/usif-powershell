Unattended Sitecore Install Framework

## Build.ps1

Calling this initiates a build of the module itself, including updating the
manifest to include exported functions (see **Public folder** below) and an
updated version.

The version is generated by incrementing the build number of the previous
version (found by reading the existing .psd1). To override this value supply
the `-ModuleVersion` (or `-Version`) parameter.

## Module Breakdown

### Public folder

By convention, the `Public` folder should contain files (matching the
containing function's name) to be exported by the module's `FunctionsToExport`
setting. During the build process, these functions are retrieved and updated
in the manifest.

### Private folder

By convention, the `Private` folder may contain files (with assorted names)
which are simply dot-sourced by the module at load time.
